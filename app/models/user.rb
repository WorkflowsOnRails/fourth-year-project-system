# User model shared by Group Members, Supervisors, and Coordinators.
#
# The model is shared to make it easier to interact with devise; instead
# of having two check two controller variables to discover the type of
# the user, we can just query the role. Additionally, the different roles
# share most of their attributes, so it's simpler to just add the role-
# specific attributes to the model, instead of creating and querying a
# one-to-one association for each role type.
